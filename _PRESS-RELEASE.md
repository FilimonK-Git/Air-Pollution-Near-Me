There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Air Pollution Near Me

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  Care about the air you breath? This app is for you!

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  When you're about to go outdoors, would you not take an umbrella if your weather app informs you it's raining? How about taking sunscreen to a sunny beach? Just as your dry cloth and skin will thank you for the precaution you take, your precious hard-working lungs will thank you for taking them into consideration when you travel outdoors. Informed people do make the right choices, and knowing the current air pollution levels of a neighborhood or historical trend of a travel destination can help you make informed travel decisions.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  Worldwide, air pollution kills about 9 million people per year (WHO). The air we breath is often polluted and the severety depends on our current location relative to major congested cities and industrial factories. According to the US EPA, the six hazardous air toxicants, termed criteria pollutants are, carbon monoxide, lead, ground-level ozone, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. The EPA continously monitors and has established national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for these criteria pollutants ...BUT a user-friendly, uncomplicated app that provides a directly digestable information is non-existent, and if it does, at best, its overwhelmening. Our team aims to solve this challenge by desining a simple app that, akin to weather app, provides our clients a direct, understandable and actionable data.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  The elegancy of our app is derived from a partnership with Ambee DataAir Technologies and their excellent api services. With ground and satelitte based air pollution data streams from over 90 countries worldwide, we stand on the shoulders of giants to streamline data consumption and have perfected the easy-of-use for our clients.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  "Filimon Kiros, CEO, we can make a difference in peoples' lives by allowing them to make informed decision about their travling activities by giving them the most latest data of the air state near them. Our obligation is to povide a simple gateway between them and a clean, simple and robust information."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  Visit airnearme.com and enter your zipcode. It's that easy!

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  Bob Dudknow: "Having lived in San Fransico bay area for over 20 years, I have witnessed the air around me getting worse over the years and just as I would check the weather daily, I also check AirNearMe before going out of my house and It has helped me chose the hours I leave my house to do grocery shopping and excersice."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

  Small choices we make everyday factor into our pursute of having a long and healthly life. Let's give our lungs a chance to get less exposure to harmful air toxins by taking into account the quality of the air that awaits them outdoors.
